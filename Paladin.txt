    We start by importing the necessary libraries and modules.
    We load the pre-trained model (maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn) and set it to evaluation mode.
    We specify the paths to the folders containing the train, test, and prediction images.
    We create an instance of the Nominatim geolocator for geocoding purposes.
    We create the output CSV file with the specified fieldnames.
    We perform the training phase by iterating over the train image files.
        For each image, we load and preprocess the image.
        We perform object detection using the pre-trained model to obtain predictions.
        We calculate the actual count of plastic objects in the image (replace with your own logic).
        We calculate the predicted count, count error, and error percentage.
        We calculate the mAP for the training data (replace with your own logic).
        We geocode the image to obtain the location information (URL).
        We write the row of data to the CSV file.
    We perform the testing phase by iterating over the test image files.
        The process is similar to the training phase, but we calculate the actual count and metrics differently.
    We perform the prediction phase by iterating over the predict image files.
        The process is similar to the training and testing phases, but we don't calculate actual count and metrics.
    Finally, we close the CSV file, and the code execution is complete.

Note: In this code, you need to replace the actual count calculation and mAP calculation with your own logic based on your specific requirements.

Summary:

1.	Importing the Required Libraries:
      o	The code starts by importing the necessary libraries for the task, including os, torch, csv, maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn from torchvision.models.detection, transforms            from torchvision.transforms, Image from PIL, and the Nominatim geocoder and related exceptions from geopy.geocoders.
2.	Loading the Pre-trained Model:
      o	The pre-trained Mask R-CNN model (maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn) is loaded and set to evaluation mode (model.eval()).
3.	Specifying Image Folder Paths:
      o	The paths to the folders containing the train, test, and predict images are specified using the variables train_folder_path, test_folder_path, and         predict_folder_path, respectively. Make sure to update these paths with the actual directory paths in your system.
4.	Creating the Geolocator:
      o	A Nominatim geocoder object is created with the user agent set to "my_geolocator". This geocoder will be used to perform geolocation.
5.	Extracting Geolocation URLs:
      o	The geolocation URLs (location_url1 and location_url2) are defined. These URLs represent the geolocation URLs associated with the respective locations.
6.	Creating the Output CSV File:
      o	The output CSV file is specified using the csv_file variable. Make sure to update this path to the desired location in your system.
      o	The fieldnames for the CSV file are defined using the fieldnames list, which specifies the column names for the output CSV.
7.	Writing the CSV Header:
      o	The CSV file is opened in write mode using with open(csv_file, 'w', newline='') as file. The csv.DictWriter class is used to write the header using the fieldnames.
      o	The header row is written to the CSV file using writer.writeheader().
8.	Processing Train Images:
      o	The code then processes the images in the train folder. It retrieves the image files from the train folder using os.listdir() and filters for files with ".jpg" or         ".png" extensions.
      o	For each image, the code loads and preprocesses the image using Image.open() and transforms.ToTensor(), respectively.
      o	Object detection is performed on the image using the pre-trained model, and the predictions are processed to calculate various metrics such as actual count, error,         percentage error, mAP_Train, and mAP_Test.
      o	A row is created for each image, populating the relevant fields, and written to the CSV file using writer.writerow().
9.	Processing Test Images:
      o	The code follows a similar process for the images in the test folder. It retrieves the image files, performs object detection, calculates metrics, and writes the         rows to the CSV file.
10.	Processing Predict Images:
      •	The code processes the images in the predict folder in a similar manner. In addition to the standard processing, geotagging is performed using the geolocator to         convert the image location to geographic coordinates.
      •	The geolocation URL is determined based on the location address obtained from geocoding. If the address matches the expected location, the corresponding         geolocation URL is assigned; otherwise, it is left empty.
      •	The row is created with the geolocation URL, and the final set of rows is written to the CSV file.
        This code performs object detection on images, calculates metrics, and writes the results to a geolocation logic.

The mean Average Precision (mAP) is typically calculated using a set of ground truth annotations and predicted bounding boxes or masks. It requires having labeled data with ground truth information to evaluate the precision and recall of the model's predictions.

To calculate mAP, you would typically follow these steps:

    Prepare your labeled dataset: Annotate your dataset with ground truth bounding boxes or masks for the objects of interest.

    Split your dataset into training and testing sets: Divide your dataset into two separate sets, one for training and one for testing.

    Train your object detection model: Use the training set to train your object detection model. You can use techniques like transfer learning with pre-trained models, such as Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN.

    Evaluate the model on the test set: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set and compare them with the ground truth annotations.

    Calculate precision and recall: Compute the precision and recall values for each class based on the predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth annotations.

    Calculate average precision (AP): Calculate the average precision for each class by computing the area under the precision-recall curve.

    Calculate mean Average Precision (mAP): Compute the mean AP across all classes to get the mAP score.

The implementation of mAP calculation depends on the specific framework and tools you are using for object detection. There are libraries available, such as the pycocotools library, which provides functions for calculating mAP.

Keep in mind that calculating mAP requires having ground truth annotations and can be a more involved process compared to other metrics. It's typically used for evaluating the performance of object detection models on specific datasets with labeled ground truth data.

If you already have labeled data with ground truth annotations, you can use the pycocotools library or other evaluation metrics provided by the object detection frameworks (such as the evaluate function in torchvision) to calculate mAP.

Note that the approach to calculate mAP may vary depending on the specific dataset and evaluation protocol. It's important to consult the documentation or guidelines specific to your dataset or evaluation setup.

If your geotagging functionality is not working as expected, here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot the issue:

    Verify geocoding service availability: Ensure that the geocoding service you're using (such as Nominatim) is accessible and available. Some services may have usage limits or restrictions, so check if there are any limitations or requirements for using the geocoding service.

    Check network connectivity: Make sure your internet connection is stable and properly configured. Geocoding services require an internet connection to retrieve location information, so verify that you have an active and reliable connection.

    Handle geocoding errors: Geocoding services may encounter errors or timeouts in certain situations. It's important to handle these errors gracefully in your code. Wrap the geocoding request with error handling mechanisms, such as try-except blocks, to catch any exceptions that may occur during the geocoding process.

    Adjust geocoding parameters: Geocoding services often provide additional parameters or options that can influence the geocoding results. Review the documentation of the geocoding service you're using to see if there are any specific parameters you need to set or configure for accurate geotagging.

    Geocoding rate limits: Geocoding services may impose rate limits to prevent abuse or excessive usage. Ensure that you're not exceeding any rate limits imposed by the geocoding service. Check the documentation or contact the service provider for more information on rate limits and usage restrictions.

    Try alternative geocoding services: If the current geocoding service is not providing satisfactory results, you can explore alternative geocoding services. There are multiple geocoding providers available, each with their own strengths and limitations. Consider trying a different geocoding service to see if it resolves the issue.

By reviewing these suggestions and addressing any potential issues or limitations, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the geotagging problem. If the issue persists, providing more specific details about the error or your geotagging implementation can help in further troubleshooting.

Annotations:
Creating annotations for images typically involves labeling or marking specific objects, regions, or attributes within an image. There are various methods and formats for image annotation depending on the specific task and requirements. Here's an overview of some common annotation techniques:

    Bounding Box Annotation: This involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest within an image. Bounding boxes indicate the location and extent of the object. Annotations can include multiple bounding boxes for different objects within the same image.

    Polygon Annotation: For objects with irregular shapes, such as vehicles or animals, polygon annotation is used. It involves drawing polygons around the object boundaries using a series of connected points.

    Semantic Segmentation: This technique assigns a semantic label to each pixel in an image, effectively segmenting the image into different regions corresponding to different object classes. Each pixel is labeled with the object it belongs to, often using color-coded masks.

    Instance Segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, but instead of grouping pixels by object class, instance segmentation assigns a unique label to each individual object instance within the image. It provides more detailed annotations by distinguishing between multiple instances of the same object class.

    Key Point Annotation: This technique involves annotating specific keypoints or landmarks within an image. It is commonly used for tasks like pose estimation or facial landmark detection. Key points are typically represented by dots or small markers.

    Text Annotation: In some cases, annotations may involve adding textual information to an image, such as labeling areas of interest, captions, or descriptions.

To create annotations, you can use dedicated annotation tools or frameworks that provide an interface for drawing annotations on images. Some popular tools include Labelbox, RectLabel, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), and CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool). These tools offer various annotation options and formats to suit different annotation requirements.

It's important to establish clear annotation guidelines and standards to ensure consistency among annotators. Providing detailed instructions, examples, and a well-defined annotation schema can help ensure accurate and reliable annotations.

Additionally, depending on the scale of your annotation task, you may consider outsourcing annotation work to specialized annotation services or crowdsourcing platforms, where multiple annotators can work on the same dataset to ensure quality and diversity in annotations.

mAP
Calculating mAP (mean Average Precision) requires evaluating the model's performance on a set of ground truth annotations and predicted detections. Here's an outline of the general steps to calculate mAP for both the train and test datasets:

    Prepare the Ground Truth Annotations: Create a file or data structure that contains the ground truth annotations for the train and test datasets. Each annotation should include the image ID, object class, and bounding box coordinates.

    Prepare the Predicted Detections: For each image in the train and test datasets, obtain the predicted detections from your model. Each detection should include the image ID, object class, bounding box coordinates, and confidence score.

    Calculate Precision and Recall: Use the ground truth annotations and predicted detections to calculate the precision and recall values for each class and across different confidence score thresholds. This involves comparing the predicted detections to the ground truth and determining whether they are true positives, false positives, or false negatives.

    Compute Average Precision: Compute the average precision for each class by calculating the area under the precision-recall curve. This is done by interpolating the precision values at different recall levels and averaging them.

    Calculate mAP: Finally, calculate the mean Average Precision (mAP) by averaging the average precision values across all classes.

Note that the specific implementation details may vary depending on the evaluation metrics and libraries you are using. Common libraries for object detection evaluation, such as COCO API or mAP calculation functions in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow, can simplify the process by providing ready-to-use functions for calculating mAP.

It's important to refer to the documentation and resources specific to the evaluation metrics and libraries you are using for more detailed instructions and code examples tailored to your specific use case

Performance:
If you are not getting any objects detected with a high score, it might be due to several reasons:

    Model Performance: The pre-trained model you are using may not be well-suited for the specific object detection task you are attempting. Different models perform differently on various object categories, and some models may not perform well on detecting specific objects like "garbage" or "paper cup." You can try using a different model or explore fine-tuning the model on a dataset that includes the objects you want to detect.

    Confidence Threshold: The code you provided includes a confidence threshold (confidence_threshold) that filters out detections below a certain score. If you have set the threshold too high, it might filter out objects with lower scores. You can try adjusting the confidence threshold to a lower value to allow more detections to be included.

    Dataset Limitations: The pre-trained model you are using might not have been trained on a diverse dataset that includes the specific objects you are trying to detect. Object detection models trained on generic datasets may not generalize well to uncommon or specific object categories. In such cases, training a custom model on a dataset that includes the desired objects may be necessary.

    Object Appearance and Quality: If the objects you are trying to detect have low contrast, complex backgrounds, or occlusions, it can make it more challenging for the model to accurately detect them. Ensure that the objects of interest are clearly visible in the images, and the images have good lighting and minimal noise.

    Model Input Size and Scaling: Different object detection models have specific input size requirements. Make sure the images you are providing as input to the model are resized and scaled appropriately to match the model's requirements. Resizing the images to the expected input size of the model can improve detection performance.

It's recommended to experiment with different models, adjust the confidence threshold, and consider fine-tuning or training a custom model to improve object detection performance for specific object categories.
